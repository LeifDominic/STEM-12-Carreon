            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Welcome Back Kyrie</h1><h4>Jan. 07, 2022</h4>
            <img src="images/kyrie.jpg"><br><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; font-size: 23px; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">On Wednesday night, we saw Kyrie Irving play his first NBA game since June 10th.<br><br>

                Irving hasn't played previously due to New York's mandate requiring players to get vaccinated against Covid-19 to access the arena.<br><br>
                
                The Brooklyn Nets and Kyrie Irving came to an agreement, which allows him to play in only road games. Kyrie, will likely miss a few other road games as well to teams like Toronto, who does not allow unvaccinated players across the border.<br><br>
                
                Nevertheless, in Kyrie's first game back he went 9-of-17 from the field for 22 points, 4 rebounds and 3 assist.
                
                Kyrie struggled early on to find his rhythm, which we all knew that would be the case considering him being out for nearly 8 months. He found his rhythm in the second quarter with a pull-up-jumper down the lane.<br><br>
                
                Irving nearly had his debut spoiled by Lance Stephenson, who just signed a 10-day contract with the Pacers. Stephenson erupted for 20 points in the first quarter for the Pacers to take a 37-32 lead. Lance finished with 30 points off the bench in his third game with the team.<br><br>
                
                Kevin Durant had a monstrous game as well, finishing with 39 points.</p><br><br>

            <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Staples Center No More!</h4><h4>Jan. 07, 2022</h4>
            <img src="images/lakers.jpg"><br><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; font-size: 23px; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers has a new name and it's going to take some getting used to.<br><br>
                The sign has been removed and the change is feeling real now. The Staples Center is no more the name of the arena nestled in the heart of downtown Los Angeles.<br><br>
                It's a changing of the guard in L.A. and for those who have followed basketball, hockey, or some of the biggest award shows in the world, Staples Center has become an institution.</p><br><br><br><br>
